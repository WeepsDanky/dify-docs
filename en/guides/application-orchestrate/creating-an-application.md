# Creating an Application

You can create applications in Dify's studio in three ways:

* Create based on an application template (recommended for beginners)
* Create a blank application
* Import via a DSL file

### Creating an Application from a Template

If you are using Dify for the first time, you might prefer to start with one of the application templates we provide for quickly creating an application. You can select "Studio" from the navigation and then choose "Create from Template" in the application list.

To help new users quickly understand the types of applications that can be built on Dify, the Dify teamâ€™s prompt engineers have created high-quality application templates for various scenarios.

### Creating a New Application

If you need to create a blank application on Dify, you can select "Studio" from the navigation and then choose "Create from Scratch" in the application list.

When creating an application for the first time, you might need to first understand the [basic concepts](./#application_type) of the four different types of applications on Dify. When creating an application, you need to give it a name and use clear and concise text to describe the purpose of the application, which will be helpful for future use within the team.

### Creating from a DSL File

If you have obtained a template (DSL file) from the community or others, you can choose "Import DSL File" from the studio. After importing, all configuration information of the original application will be loaded directly.

**Note:**
Dify DSL is an AI application engineering file standard defined by Dify.AI in version 0.6 and later. The file format is YML. This standard covers the basic description of the application, model parameters, orchestration configuration, and other information.
